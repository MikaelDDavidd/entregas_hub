/Users/mikaeldavid/Documents/GitHub/eaasy_stock/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:3: Warning: READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should instead use one or more new storage permissions: READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO or READ_MEDIA_AUDIO. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

/Users/mikaeldavid/Documents/GitHub/eaasy_stock/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:4: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to write to shared storage, use the MediaStore.createWriteRequest intent. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media
   files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new
   storage permissions:
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

   and then add maxSdkVersion="33" to the older permission. See the developer
   guide for how to do this:
   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granula
   r-media-permissions

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

/Users/mikaeldavid/Documents/GitHub/eaasy_stock/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21: Warning: This folder configuration (v21) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 21. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
